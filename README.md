# libcal-times
These scripts are used in conjunction with the library hours widgets provided in Springshare's LibCal system. Created with claude.ai, the scripts reformat the times displayed on web pages to match my university's editorial style, which is based on the AP Stylebook. We use the Today's Hours view, Weekly Grid View, and the Monthly Calendar View.
